    "Grade inflation is a reference to the trend of increasin grade over time, in this case, at universities. Experts find grade inflation to be a significant issue in society because it signals that students shouldn't try as hard to get the grade that they deserve.1 In addition, it may signal to employers that students are not prepared to leave their learning and join the workforce.1 Thus, universities try to curb the impact of grade inflation by grading on a curve and reducing the number of As given much to the chargin of students. This system was created in hopes for students feel as if they deserved their grade more, although someone has to fill the lower quota of students.2\n",
    "\n",
    "There hasn't been much research on grade inflation at UCSD especially on a department level. However, we do know that the average GPA of UCSD students has increased from 2000 to 2015 from a 3.0 to a 3.153. This analysis is limited to an overall perspective and we don't know if a particular department drives this growth. In addition, this increase may not even be attributed to grade inflation but the growth of UCSD to a more prestigious university. 4 There has been research done on grade inflation on a national level and some researchers find that \"grades have risen at high schools and dropped at four-year colleges, in general, and selective four-year institutions, in particular\". This heavily contridicts previous reporting most likely because this research paper defines grade inflation as the \"signalling power of grades\".5\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research aims to build on previous research in a couple different ways. Firstly, our research would include more recent student grades from Fall Quarter 2023. In addition, we would aim to understand inflation on a departmental level since there many be specific departments that award higher grades every year compared to other departments."

    "Grade inflation at UCSD (from 2007 Summer Session to 2023 Spring) has become more prominent specifically in the humanties departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we think that grade inflation has increased at UCSD because grade inflation has been a trend in other top universities like the Ivy Leagues. In order to keep up with the competition, other universities like the UC system, including UCSD have implemented systems to increase grades. In addition, due to COVID-19 online resources like Chat-GPT and Chegg have become more common which has lead to the democratization of information. We believe that this results in students doing better in class and thus increasing grades. The reason why we suspect this to be the case in the humanities departments is because those classes have become more labor based instead of based on a specific criteria. Writing classes at UCSD have become more forgiving in writing standards in order to become a more inclusive place for ideas and growth."

    "The UCSD CAPEs Dataset has 11 different variables that consist of the questions that students answer when filling out the CAPEs end of the year form. The variable names are Instructor, Course, Quarter, Total Enrolled in Course, Total CAPEs Given, Percentage Recommended Class, Percentage Recommended Professor, Study Hours per Week, Average Grade Expected, Average Grade Received, and Evalulation URL. The column Course refers to the particular course number with the name of the course (ie. AAS 10 - Intro/African-American Studies) as a string. The Average Grade Expected and Average Grade Received are all string columns that provide the letter grade and a GPA version of the grade. In addition, Study Hours per Week column is a float number that describes the average number of hours students spent studying that week.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the data is clean enough because the data came from a form that students should fill in and most of the data is a drop down, a multiple choice question, or autofilled from the student's academic record. For the preprocessing, we need to drop all rows that have a n/a value for Average Grade Expected and Average Grade Received since without it you can't create a proper GPA for that course. Next we need to drop unnecessary columns and switch datatypes for the GPA columns for easier calculation."

We can see that there are no significant outliers in either the humanities and STEM departments because there wasn't a particular year where GPAs were much greater than or less than compared to previous years. However, we look at the data in each year we can see more of a distribution and more outliers. For example, there is a clear outlier in the humanities graph in 2007 where there was a department that had an average grade of <2.0. However in the bigger picture, we can see that the data has no outliers."

The grade expected and the grade recieved are different because the people who fill out capes are a different section than the overall class demographic. While this selection bias exists in the dataset, we don't suspect it having a large affect on the conclusions made by our research. This reason why this is the case is because we are studying an overall trend of growth or decay in grades. If this bias where to exist, then it would exist in every year that we analyze CAPES so ranges would be uneffected by this bias.\n",
