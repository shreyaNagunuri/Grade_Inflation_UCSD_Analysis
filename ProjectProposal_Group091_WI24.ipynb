    "   Grade inflation is a reference to the trend of increasin grade over time, in this case, at universities.

This system was created in hopes for students feel as if they deserved their grade more, although someone has to fill the lower quota of students.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) \n",

    "Grade inflation at UCSD (from 2007 Summer Session to 2023 Spring) has become more prominent specifically in the humanties departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we think that grade inflation has increased at UCSD because grade inflation has been a trend in other top universities like the Ivy Leagues. In order to keep up with the competition, other universities like the UC system, including UCSD have implemented systems to increase grades. In addition, due to COVID-19 online resources like Chat-GPT and Chegg have become more common which has lead to the democratization of information. We believe that this results in students doing better in class and thus increasing grades. The reason why we suspect this to be the case in the humanities departments is because those classes have become more labor based instead of based on a specific criteria. Writing classes at UCSD have become more forgiving in writing standards in order to become a more inclusive place for ideas and growth. "
